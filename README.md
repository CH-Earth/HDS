# HDS
A modified version (v2) of the Hysteretic Depressional Storage (HDS) model to simulate prairie fill and spill mechanism.

The [original HDS (v1)](https://github.com/UC-HAL/HYPE-HDS) was based on the equations listed in Ahmed et al. (2023), doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2023.105769. This version of HDS (v2) is revised based on the equations presented by Clark and Shook (2022), doi: https://doi.org/10.1029/2022WR032694, which are more numerically effecient than the ones proposed in HDS (v1).
